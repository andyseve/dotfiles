General information about files in this project
1. Most of the folders contain setup scripts that should perform basic linking tasks
2. This does contain some git sub modules. I have usually not added these as sub modules, and preferred to deal with them using something else. Most of them are going to be linked to something else, so they will be updated using some other means.
3. [TODO] Add program specific setup information for some complicated program setups. Preferably add scripts that take care of the installation, or at least list commands.
4. [TODO] Add scripts to deal with other basic installation setups.
